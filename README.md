<h1> Team25 - Project Ideas </h1>

Note: None of the ideas were approved in class so we came up with some new ideas

Idea 1 Likelihood of a Work Visa approval: 

	Abstract: H-1B Visa is the most sought-after non-immigrant visa that allows foreign workers to work in the United States in specialty occupation. In 2019, more than 1 million applicants applied to get an H-1B visa. From this pool a total of  more than 180,000 were new applications and only 80,000 were selected for the lottery process. The United States department of labor publishes a dataset which is anonymized and publicly released. We plan to apply Data science techniques to study the trends and create a prediction model for approval which can be used by both employers and employees for risk estimation. 
	Approach: We intend to create a dashboard where users can enter answers to specific questions and then use a prediction model to predict the likelihood of a visa approval. We also plan to use data from other websites to help immigrants answer common questions
	Persona: Immigrant Workers
	Dataset:https://www.kaggle.com/nsharan/h-1b-visa/data and https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/foreign-labor/performance#dis 

Idea 2 Dashboard for Diabetic Retinopathy Detection for Ophthalmologists in India: 

	Abstract: India has approximately 77 million people suffering from Diabetes. Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a complication of diabetes that can cause blindness to those who suffer it. Detecting DR is a time-consuming task that requires expert clinicians and can often lead to a delay in treatment due to the slow nature of the process. There are lots of areas in India that lack the expertise required to cope up with the rising rate of diabetes. We want to create a dashboard that would automate the process of identifying DR so that help can be given to those who need it urgently.   	 	
	Approach: We intend to create a dashboard where opthamologists in India can upload a high resolution image of a retina scan, and by using a complex CNN architecture we intend to detect Diabetic Retinopathy. This dashboard can also be used as a database where opthamologists can store patientâ€™s info and even rank them in terms of priority depending on the severity of the diagnosis
	Persona: Ophthalmologists
	Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/c/diabetic-retinopathy-detection/data, https://www.kaggle.com/c/aptos2019-blindness-detection/data  

Idea 3 Meetup web-app: 

Abstract: Our product is a peer to peer platform created to bring people together at SJSU for special events, study sessions, gym workouts, etc. We allow people to make a profile and search around the app in organized categories to find matches for their interests. 
As an incoming student, it is really easy to get lost in such a big crowd and this problem is mainly faced by international or out-of-state students, who find it difficult to connect with classmates. The problem is further amplified by the current pandemic situation which can lead to a student feeling isolated and lonely, and this in turn can affect their academic performance. 
	Approach: Our goal is to create a user friendly web application which will allow users to sign-up and meet people with similar interests. 
	Persona: SJSU students


Idea 4 Chatbot for incoming SJSU students:

Abstract:  Most of the students either applying for SJSU or newly admitted to SJSU have many common queries regarding stuff like application process, and other university related queries which generally require writing an email to their department advisors or the ISSS. This chatbot is used to answer commonly asked questions or redirect students to an appropriate department. This gives them faster responses while also reducing the workload of the people working at SJSU. 
Approach: We would use NLP to detect keywords and then link them to appropriate answers which can then be used in a chatbot application
Persona: SJSU Students
Dataset: We plan to create a dataset by asking departments like ISSS, Admissions for commonly asked questions while also researching on the web to build a comprehensive model.
