# Team25 - Project Ideas

Idea 1 Chatbot for incoming SJSU students: We will use commononly asked questions (like how many credits are needed to be a full-time student? Or where to find housing?) to help assist new incoming students.

Idea 2 Pneumonia Detection from Chest X-Rays: A computer aided dashboard to help radiologists to detect Pneumonia using CNN.

Idea 3 Likelihood of a Work visa approval: We will use the data from United States Department of Labor and other sources to predict whether an H1B-visa would get approved or not and help immigrants answer other questions
